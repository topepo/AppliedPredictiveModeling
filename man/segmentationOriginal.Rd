\description{
Hill, LaPan, Li and Haney (2007) develop models to predict which cells in a
high content screen were well segmented.  The data consists of 119 imaging
measurements on 2019. The original analysis used 1009 for training and 1010
as a test set (see the column called \code{Case}).
}
\details{
The outcome class is contained in a factor variable called \code{Class} with
levels "PS" for poorly segmented and "WS" for well segmented.

A pre-processed version of these data can be found in the \pkg{caret}
package.
