\description{
The \url{http://fueleconomy.gov} website, run by the U.S. Department of
Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, lists different estimates of fuel economy
for passenger cars and trucks. For each vehicle, various characteristics are
recorded such as the engine displacement or number of cylinders. Along with
these values, laboratory measurements are made for the city and highway
miles per gallon (MPG) of the car.
}
\details{
Predictors extracted from the website include: \code{EngDispl},
\code{NumCyl}, \code{Transmission}, \code{AirAspirationMethod},
\code{NumGears}, \code{TransLockup}, \code{TransCreeperGear},
\code{DriveDesc}, \code{IntakeValvePerCyl}, \code{ExhaustValvesPerCyl},
\code{CarlineClassDesc}, \code{VarValveTiming} and \code{VarValveLift}. The
outcome used in the book is in column \code{FE} and is the unadjusted
highway data.
