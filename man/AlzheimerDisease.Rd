\description{
Washington University conducted a clinical study to determine if biological
measurements made from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can be used to diagnose or
predict Alzheimer's disease (Craig-Schapiro et al. 2011). These data are a
modified version of the values used for the publication.
}
\details{
The R factor vector \code{diagnosis} contains the outcome data for 333 of
the subjects. The demographic and laboratory results are collected in the
data frame \code{predictors}.

One important indicator of Alzheimer's disease is the genetic background of
a subject. In particular, what versions of the Apolipoprotein E gene
inherited from one's parents has an association with the disease. There are
three variants of the gene: E2, E3 and E4. Since a child inherits a version
of the gene from each parent, there are six possible combinations (e.g.
E2/E2, E2/E3, and so on). This data is contained in the predictor column
named \code{Genotype}.
