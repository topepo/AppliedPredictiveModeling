\value{
\code{ChemicalManufacturingProcess}: a data frame with columns for
the outcome (\code{Yield}) and the predictors (\code{BiologicalMaterial01}

\description{
This data set contains information about a chemical manufacturing process,
in which the goal is to understand the relationship between the process and
the resulting final product yield.  Raw material in this process is put
through a sequence of 27 steps to generate the final pharmaceutical product.
The starting material is generated from a biological unit and has a range of
quality and characteristics.  The objective in this project was to develop a
model to predict percent yield of the manufacturing process.  The data set
consisted of 177 samples of biological material for which 57 characteristics
were measured.  Of the 57 characteristics, there were 12 measurements of the
biological starting material, and 45 measurements of the manufacturing
process.  The process variables included measurements such as temperature,
drying time, washing time, and concentrations of by--products at various
steps.  Some of the process measurements can be controlled, while others are
observed.  Predictors are continuous, count, categorical; some are
correlated, and some contain missing values.  Samples are not independent
because sets of samples come from the same batch of biological starting
material.
