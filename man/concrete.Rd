\item{concrete}{data frame of data with predictor columns
\code{Cement}, \code{BlastFurnaceSlag}, \code{FlyAsh}, \code{Water},
\code{Superplasticizer}, \code{CoarseAggregate}, \code{FineAggregate} and
\code{Age} with response column \code{CompressiveStrength}. These are the

\description{
Yeh (1998) describes a collection of data sets from different sources that
can be used for modeling the compressive strength of concrete formulations
as a functions of their ingredients and age.
}
\details{
The data are from Yeh (1998) and taken from the UCI ML website
\url{http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Concrete+Compressive+Strength}.

There are 1030 data points from the UCI website, but the paper states that
approximately 1,000 samples were made, but only 727 were analyzed in the
source material. It is unclear which samples were excluded.
